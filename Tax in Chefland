In Chefland, a tax of rupees 1010 is deducted if the total income is strictly greater than rupees 100100.

Given that total income is XX rupees, find out how much money you get.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer XX — your total income.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the amount of money you get.

Constraints
1 \leq T \leq 1001≤T≤100

Explanation:
Test case 11: Your total income is 55 rupees which is less than 100100 rupees. Thus, no tax would be deducted and you get 55 rupees.

Test case 22: Your total income is 105105 rupees which is greater than 100100 rupees. Thus, a tax of 1010 rupees would be deducted and you get 105-10 = 95105−10=95 rupees.

Test case 33: Your total income is 101101 rupees which is greater than 100100 rupees. Thus, a tax of 1010 rupees would be deducted and you get 101-10 = 91101−10=91 rupees.

Test case 44: Your total income is 100100 rupees which is equal to 100100 rupees. Thus, no tax would be deducted and you get 100100 rupees.

1. USING C++14
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int x;
	cin>>x;
	while(x--)
	{
	    int y;
	    cin>>y;
	    if(y>100)
	    cout<<y-10<<endl;
	    else
	    cout<<y<<endl;
	}
	return 0;
}


2.PYTHON
x = int(input())
while x!=0:
    y = int(input())
    if y>100:
        print(y-10)
    else:
        print(y)
    x-=1
